## 📦 Installation

### ⭐ Recommended — one-command install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/RaceConditionWinner/Kde-windows-system-tray/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

This automatically:

- downloads the prebuilt System Tray plugin and verifies it against SHA-256 checksums
- installs and activates the WindowsModern-WhiteSurApps icon theme
- replaces the stock System Tray on your panel, preserving its position
- reloads Plasma and verifies the install

It's safe to run more than once. Only the plugin-install step requires
administrator authentication via `pkexec`; the rest runs as your user.

### 🛠️ Manual installation

For other distros, or if you'd rather build from source.

1. Install build dependencies (Fedora shown; see [system-tray/BUILD.md](system-tray/BUILD.md) for Arch/Debian/Ubuntu):
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install gcc-c++ cmake extra-cmake-modules \
     qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtdeclarative-devel \
     kf6-kpackage-devel kf6-kconfig-devel kf6-ki18n-devel kf6-kcoreaddons-devel \
     kf6-kwindowsystem-devel kf6-kio-devel kf6-kiconthemes-devel \
     kf6-kitemmodels-devel kf6-kservice-devel kf6-kxmlgui-devel \
     kf6-kjobwidgets-devel kf6-kcmutils-devel \
     libplasma-devel plasma-workspace-devel plasma-workspace-libs
   ```
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RaceConditionWinner/Kde-windows-system-tray.git
   cd Kde-windows-system-tray
   ```
3. Build and install:
   ```bash
   cd system-tray
   ./dev.sh
   ```
4. Add "System Tray (Windows Modern)" to your panel: right-click the panel → **Add or Manage Widgets…**
5. (Optional) Install the icon theme, still from inside `system-tray/`:
   ```bash
   cp -r ../windows-icon/WindowsModern-WhiteSurApps ~/.local/share/icons/
   ```
   then set it via System Settings → Colors & Themes → Icons.

The manual path builds from source and never touches your panel layout automatically.

## ✅ Requirements

- KDE Plasma 6
- **Fedora KDE Plasma 6, x86_64** — the only environment the prebuilt release is currently built and tested for. Other distributions should use [manual installation](#-manual-installation).

## 🗑️ Uninstall

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/RaceConditionWinner/Kde-windows-system-tray/releases/latest/download/uninstall.sh | bash
```

Restores the stock System Tray in its original position, restores your
previous icon theme, and removes the Windows Modern plugin. Safe to run
more than once.

## 🧑‍💻 Development

Source code lives in [`system-tray/`](system-tray) — see
[`system-tray/BUILD.md`](system-tray/BUILD.md) for build dependencies and
development instructions. The icon theme is under
[`windows-icon/WindowsModern-WhiteSurApps/`](windows-icon/WindowsModern-WhiteSurApps).
